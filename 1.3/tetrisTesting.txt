I tested this project by using all of the movement functions to verify that all of the keys perform what they are supposed to do, and the pieces do not interact in any glitchy ways. I played for around 5-10 minutes, verifying that the gravity mode swapped the board and piece dropping without errors over time. Line clears of all lengths are confirmed to work by clearing lines of various lengths. All pieces rotate, and can be hard and soft dropped, which was confirmed by using these functions on them.
